# Mining-Astro-Signals-using-Spark

## This project was executed on [Bridges-2](https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/), [Pittsburgh Super Computing Centre's](https://www.psc.edu/) flagship super computer.

A pdf of the code and its corresponding output can be found [here!](https://github.com/Ruchita1003/Mining-Astro-Signals-using-Spark/blob/main/Mining_Astro_Signals_using_Spark.pdf).

The steps mentioned below should be followed before executing the code in the aforementioned pdf:
1) Log into Bridges-2 via the terminal.
2) cp the datafile to where you want to work with you PySpark Session.
3) get an interactive node
4) load the spark module
5) start a pyspark session
6) load a datafile and start exploring the space! :satellite: :telescope:  :stars:
